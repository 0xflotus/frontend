  .offset6.span8.alert-message.block-message#per-developer-plan
    All plans are per developer per month.
    Your plan covers all <b>your</b> builds, in all branches, in all repositories.
    It does not cover your colleagues, who will need their own accounts.
    (We currently do not enforce this, but will in the near future).
