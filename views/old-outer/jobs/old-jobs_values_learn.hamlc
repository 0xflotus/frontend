  %h3 Lots to Learn
  %p
    We try to hire really really high caliber people.
    We look for the very experienced, or the very talented (and generally both)!
    If you work at CircleCI, you know that you won't be on the team with slouches or slackers, or folks who will hold you back.
    Only hardcore hackers who you'll hold in high esteem.
    That means there's lot to learn, and we hope to learn lots from you too.
