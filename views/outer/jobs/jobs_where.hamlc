    %h4 Local
    %p We have lovely office in the dodgy end of SoMa in San Francisco, near Heroku, Twitter, Zynga, Pinterest, Atlassian, and many other startups.
    %p We have catered lunches, a great office atmosphere, and lovely colleagues.
    %p Please note that we only hire people who are currently in the US or have US work authorization (though we're happy to work on transferring visa paperwork).

    %h4 Remote
    %p We have an asynchronous culture that is well suited to remote-working. We use HipChat, Skype and email heavily, and currently four of our six engineers are working remotely. We'll bring you on-site every 8 weeks or so, and can do this according to your schedule.
    %p At the moment, we're only looking for remote folks who are based in the US.
