      %h4 What our perfect front-end developer will have:
      %ul
        %li knowledge of common HTML5 implementation strategies,
        %li experience building fat JS apps,
        %li experience designing complex stateful apps in a maintainable way,
        %li experience using HTML5 frameworks, such as Ember, Angular, Backbone, Knockout, Batman, Spine, Bootstrap, etc,
        %li experience with data visualization, such as D3 or Processing,
        %li good knowledge of algorithmic design and CS theory (informally, CS degree not required),
        %li good UX sensibilities,
        %li preferred if you aren't awful at visual design so that prototypes can be shipped and iterated on afterwards.
      %p Backend knowledge is not required, but we expect that you're not helpless if a change requires simple backend changes.
