  %h4 Culture
  %p Our culture is product-driven.
    Our customers and our founders are engineers, and most of our employees will be too. We are inspired by companies like

  %p We have a flat organization.
    There are no managers, no org-chart and no hierarchy, and we plan to keep it that way for as long as possible. Everyone gets access to all company information and can be involved in decision-making. By keeping communication open and transparent, we believe everybody is able to make good decisions about the best thing to work on.
  %p We have a very strong focus on productivity, and on shipping code.
    This means you'll have a lot of days where you finish the day with the happy glow of having achieved something. We ship often, and shape our work lives around enabling that.
  %p We spend a lot of time talking to customers.
    We make it really easy for customers to reach out to us, and we reach out to them to ask for their feedback too. This means you'll probably spend at least one day per week listening to and fixing their problems. We refer to that day as "support", but really think of it as "customer development".
