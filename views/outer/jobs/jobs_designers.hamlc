      %p Although we talk a lot about engineers, great design is really important to us, and we're looking for great designers to help us with it.

      %p
        %strong We are a very design-focused company.
        We think deeply about UX and experience for our customers.
        We spend a lot of time thinking about how our customers experience Circle,
        how to speak to them in a way in which they identify with,
        and allowing them solve complex problems simply.
        Everybody at Circle talks to customers, and you will too.
        We value your role in this,
        and the rest of the team is very motivated to work with you to solve these problems.

      %p
        %strong At the same time, you'll have a high level of responsibility.
        Companies live and die by beautiful functional design,
        and so we are looking for the perfect designer who understands both the product and our customers.

      %p
        %strong You'll also be able to work on a lot of cool things.
        As well as an interesting technical stack and a smart team,
        you'll get to work with seriously experienced mentors and investors in important areas such as branding, positioning and messaging.
        You'll be responsible for taking these high level concepts and implementing everything from assets and artwork, to front-page and landing page designs, to logos and tshirts.

      %h4 What our perfect designer will have:

          The most important thing is an ability to relate to our customers,
          who are typically software developers.
          Designers with a CS degree, who hang out with developers,
          have worked a lot with developers, built developer-facing tools,
          etc, are strongly encouraged.
        %li
          A requirement for designers is that you can implement your own stuff.
          We need to ship quickly, so you need to be able to turn designs into CSS and HTML.

        %li
          Deep JavaScript experience is not required,
          but you'll need to roughly know your way around and change things if required.

        %li
          A willingness to learn about backend code and tech would be lovely
          (you won't need to implement it, but its kinda required to relate to our customers).

        %li
          We're looking for someone who likes to ship often,
          believes "done is better than perfect", and prefers to iterate after shipping,
          instead of waiting for the perfect design.

        %li
          Interest and experience in branding and messaging.
