      %h4 What kind of folks we like:
      %ul
        %li people who truly care about making developers more productive,

        %li pleasant people, and good conversationalists - we'll be spending the next few years together after all,

        %li being easy to work with: we're not interesting in solo artists, divas, people who always know best, or assholes,

        %li we tend to get on well with folks that do not identify with the words "ninja", "pirate", "rock star", or (especially) "brogrammer",

        %li great communicators.


      %h4 Extra skills

      %p In addition to the standard skillsets for your position, we love to hear from people with:

      %ul
        %li A working knowledge of dev-marketing, such as the writings of patio11 or other dev-marketers, and ability to discuss different types of conversion rate optimization, customer lifecycle marketing, virality, and other "growth hacks". Experience a serious plus.
        %li An interest in the business side of things. We have a flat transparent organization, and that allows everyone on the team to take a holistic view of the company. As a result, it's great to find folks who are interested in taking that holistic view.
