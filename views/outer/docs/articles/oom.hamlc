    %p
      Your build contains a message that says the Linux Out-of-Memory
      killer ran.

    %p
      The reason for this is your builds run in a VM with 2GB of
      available RAM. If you go over that limit, Linux kills a process,
      somewhat arbitrarily.

    %p
      Unfortunately, there's no good way for us to know which process
      was killed. While testing, it's commonly your application, or
      DB, or web browser.

    %p
      Hitting the RAM limit is typically a bug. If your tests actually
      need more than 2GB of RAM, please contact us.
