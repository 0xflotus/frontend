      Circle is completely configurable.
      While we have a very simple setup for projects that follow established conventions, we also support many variations on the theme.

    %ul
      %li
        We support
        %a{href: "/docs/configuration#subdirectory"} running tests from a subdirectory of your repository.

      %li
        You can completely
        %a{href: "/docs/configuration"} override every single step of your tests
        with custom settings, or minor tweaks.
