  Integration tests can be hard to debug, especially when they're running on a remote machine. Circle supports X11 forwarding over SSH to make this process much easier.

%p
  Before you start, make sure you have an X Window System on your computer. If you're using OSX, I recommend
  = succeed '.', ->
    %a{href: 'http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/'} XQuartz

%p
  With X set up on your system,
  %a{href: '/docs/ssh-build'} start an SSH build
  to a Circle VM, using the
  %code -X
  flag to set up forwarding:

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserve
      daniel@mymac$ ssh -X -p PORT ubuntu@IP_ADDRESS

%p
  This will start an SSH session with X11 forwarding enabled.
  To connect your VM's display to your machine, set the display environment variable to localhost:10.0

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserve
      ubuntu@box10$ export DISPLAY=localhost:10.0

%p
  Check that everything is working by starting xclock.

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserve
      ubuntu@box10$ xclock

%p
  You can kill xclock with Ctrl+c after it appears on your desktop.

%p
  Now you can run your integration tests from the command line and watch the browser for unexpected behavior. You can even interact with the browser &mdash; it's as if the tests were running on your local machine!
