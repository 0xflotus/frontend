%h2 Overview

%p
  Circle automatically infers your settings from your code, so Circle's normal processing works just fine in most circumstances.
  When it doesn't, the
  %code circle.yml
  file makes it easy to tell Circle what you need.
  This is a simple YAML file where you spell out any tweaks required for your web app.
  You place the file in your git repo's root directory and Circle reads the file each time it runs a build.

%p
  If you want a quick look at how to set up your
  %code circle.yml
  file, check out our
  = succeed '.', ->
    %a{href: "/docs/config-sample"} sample file


%p
  Should you have a test failure, our
  %a{ href: "/docs/troubleshooting" } troubleshooting section
  can likely tell you the best way to solve the problem.
  If you find yourself repeateadly consulting this guide, please
  = HAML['contact_us']()
  and let us know what you're working on.
  We'll try to make it easier for you.




%p
  One more thing&mdash;most projects should put the
  %code circle.yml
  file in their repo's root directory.
  However, if you store your application code in a subdirectory instead of the root, putting the
  %code circle.yml
  file in that subdirectory tells Circle to look for your app in that subdirectory.


%h2#phases File structure and content

%p
  The
  %code circle.yml
  file is made up of six sections.
  Each section represents a
  %em phase
  of running your tests:

%ul
  %li <b>machine</b>: adjusting the VM to your preferences and requirements
  %li <b>checkout</b>: checking out and cloning your git repo
  %li <b>dependencies</b>: setting up your project's language-specific dependencies
  %li <b>database</b>: preparing the databases for your tests
  -#%li <b>compile</b>: compiling your code or assets (if necessary)
  %li <b>test</b>: running your tests
  -#%li <b>artifact</b>: uploading your artifacts for distribution
  %li <b>deployment</b>: deploying your code to your web servers

%p
  Remember: most projects won't need to specify anything for many of the phases.


%p
  The sections contain lists of bash commands.  If you don't specify
  commands, Circle infers them from your code.  Commands are run in
  the order they appear in the file; all test commands are run to
  completion, but a non-zero exit code during setup will cause the
  build to fail early.  You can modify which&mdash;and
  when&mdash;commands are run by adding <code>override</code>,
  <code>pre</code> and/or <code>post</code> to adjust Circle's
  inferred commands.  Here's how it works:


%ul
  %li <b>pre</b>: commands run before Circle's inferred commands
  %li <b>override</b>: commands run instead of Circle's inferred commands
  %li <b>post</b>:  commands run after Circle's inferred commands


%p
  Each command is run in a separate shell.
  As such, they do not share an environment with their predecessors, so be aware that
  %code export foo=bar
  in particular does not work.
  If you'd like to set an environment variable globally, you can specify them in the <a href="#machine">Machine configuration</a> section, described below.

%h4 Modifiers

%p
  You can tweak individual commands by adding a modifier.
  Allowed modifiers are:

%ul
  %li <b>timeout</b>: if a command runs this many seconds without output, kill it (default:180s)
  %li <b>pwd</b>: run commands using this value as the current working directory (default: the checkout directory named for your project)
  %li
    <b>environment</b>: a hash creating a list of environment variables set for this command
    (see <a href="#machine">Machine configuration</a> for this modifier's properties when used in the <code>machine</code> section of the file)
  %li
    <b>parallel</b>: (only used with commands in the <code>test</code> section)
    if you have <a href="/docs/parallel-manual-setup"> manually set up parallelism</a>, set this to true to run a command across all VMs


%p
  Note that YAML is very strict about indentation each time you add a new property.
  For that reason, modifiers must be indented one level from their command.
  In the following example, we treat the
  %code bundle install
  command as a key, with <code>timeout</code>, <code>environment</code>, and <code>pwd</code> as the command's hash values.


%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      dependencies:
        override:
          - bundle install:
              timeout: 240
              environment:
                foo: bar
                foo2: bar2
              pwd:
                test_dir
%p

%h2#machine Machine configuration

%p
  The
  %code machine
  section enables you to configure the virtual machine that runs your tests.

%p
  Here's an illustration of the types of things you might typically set in the
  %code machine
  section of the file.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        timezone:
          America/Los_Angeles
        ruby:
          version: 1.9.3-p0-falcon

      test:
        post:
          \- bundle exec rake custom:test:suite
%p
%p
  This example sets the
  = succeed ",", ->
    %a{ href: "#timezone" }<
      time zone
  chooses a
  %a{href: "#ruby-version"} Ruby version
  and patchset,
  and adds a custom test command
  to run after the rest of your commands.


%p
  Although
  %code pre
  and
  %code post
  are supported in the
  %code machine
  section,
  %code override
  is not.
  Here's how you might adjust the <code>circle.yml</code> file using
  %code pre
  to install a different version of <code>phantomjs</code> than the version Circle has installed.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        pre:
          - curl -k -L -o phantomjs.tar.bz2 http://phantomjs.googlecode.com/files/phantomjs-1.8.2-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
          - tar -jxf phantomjs.tar.bz2
%p
%h3
  Environment

%p
  You set environment variables for <b>all commands</b> in the build by adding
  %code environment
  to the
  %code machine
  section.
  Remember that Circle uses a new shell for every command; as previously mentioned
  %code export foo=bar
  won't work. Instead, you must include something like this.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        environment:
          foo: bar
          baz: 123
%p
  If you don't want to use this method, there are
  <a href="/docs/environment-variables">a number of other options</a>.

%h3
  Timezone

%p
  The machine's time zone is UTC by default.
  You use
  %code timezone
  to adjust to the same time zone as your <i>production</i> server.
  Changing the time to your <i>development</i> machine's time zone is <b>asking for trouble</b>.

%p
  This modifier tells Circle to
  overwrite
  %code /etc/timezone
  and then restart all databases and services that rely on it.
  This modifier supports any time zone listed in the IANA time zone database.
  You can find this by looking in
  %code /usr/share/zoneinfo/
  on your Unix machine or in the
  %strong TZ
  column in
  = succeed ".", ->
    %a{href: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones"}<
      Wikipedia's list of TZ database time zones

%p
  Be aware that some developers, especially those that collaborate across different time zones, do use UTC on their production servers.
  This alternative can avoid horrific Daylight Saving Time (DST) bugs.

%h3
  Hosts

%p
  Sometimes you might need to add one or more entries to the
  %code /etc/hosts
  file to assign various domain names to an IP address.
  This example points to the development subdomain at the circleci hostname and IP address.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        hosts:
          dev.circleci.com: 127.0.0.1
          foobar: 1.2.3.4
%p

%h3
  Ruby version

%p
  Circle uses
  %a{ href: "https://rvm.io/" } RVM
  to manage Ruby versions.
  We use the Ruby version you specify in your <code>.rvmrc</code>, your
  %code .ruby-version
  file, or your Gemfile.
  If you don't have one of these files,
  we'll use Ruby
  %code
    = CI.Versions.default_ruby
  or
  = succeed ',', ->
    %code= CI.Versions.old_ruby
  whichever we think is better.
  If you use a different Ruby version let Circle know by including that information in the
  %code machine
  section. Here's an example of how you do that.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        ruby:
          version: 1.9.3-p0-falcon
%p
  The complete list of supported Ruby versions is found
  = succeed ".", ->
    %a{href: "/docs/environment#ruby"} here

%h3#node-version
  Node.js version


%p
  Circle uses
  %a{ href: "https://github.com/creationix/nvm" } NVM
  to manage Node versions.
  See
  %a{href: "/docs/environment#nodejs"} supported Node versions
  for a complete list.
  If you do not specify a version, Circle uses
  = succeed '.', ->
    %code= CI.Versions.default_node
  Note that recent versions of NVM support selecting versions through
  package.json.
  If your version of NVM supports this, we recommend you use it.

%p
  Here's an example of how to set the version of Node.js to be used for your tests.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        node:
          version: 0.6.18
%p

%h3
  Java version

%p
  Here's an example of how to set the version of Java to be used for your tests.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        java:
          version: openjdk7
%p
  The default version of Java is <code>oraclejdk7</code>.
  See
  %a{href: "/docs/environment#java"} supported Java versions
  for a complete list.

%h3
  PHP version

%p
  Circle uses
  %a{href: "https://github.com/CHH/php-build"} php-build
  and
  %a{href: "https://github.com/CHH/phpenv"} phpenv
  to manage PHP versions.
  Here's an example of how to set the version of PHP used for your tests.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        php:
          version: 5.4.5
%p
%p
  See
  %a{href: "/docs/environment#php"} supported PHP versions
  for a complete list.

%h3
  Python version

%p
  Circle uses
  %a{href: "https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv"} pyenv
  to manage Python versions.
  Here's an example of how to set the version of Python used for your tests.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        python:
          version: 2.7.5

%p
%p
  See
  %a{href: "/doc/environment#python"} supported Python versions
  for a complete list.

%h3
  Other languages

%p
  Our
  %a{ href: "/docs/environment" } test environment
  document has more configuration information about
  %a{ href: "/docs/environment#other" } other languages
  including
  <a href="/docs/environment#python">Python</a>,
  <a href="/docs/environment#clojure">Clojure</a>,
  <a href="/docs/environment#other">C/C++</a>,
  <a href="/docs/environment#other">Golang</a>
  and
  <a href="/docs/environment#other">Erlang</a>.


%h3#services
  Databases and other services

%p
  Circle supports a large number of
  <a href="/docs/environment#databases">databases and other services</a>.
  Most popular ones are running by default on our build machines, including Postgres, MySQL, Redis and MongoDB.

%p
  You can enable other databases and services from the
  %code services
  section:

%pre
  %code<>
    :preserves
      machine:
        services:
          - cassandra
          - elasticsearch
          - rabbitmq-server
          - riak
          - beanstalkd
          - couchbase-server
          - neo4j


%h2#checkout Code checkout from GitHub

%p
  The <code>checkout</code> section is usually pretty vanilla, but we include examples of common things you might need to put in the section.
  You can modify commands by including <code>override</code>, <code>pre</code>, and/or <code>post</code>.

.top-caption
  Example: using git submodules

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      checkout:
        post:
          - git submodule init
          - git submodule update
%p

.top-caption
  Example: overwriting configuration files on Circle
%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      checkout:
        post:
          - mv config/.app.yml config/app.yml

%h2#dependencies Project-specific dependencies

%p
  Most web programming languages and frameworks, including Ruby's bundler, npm for Node.js, and Python's pip, have some form of dependency specification;
  Circle automatically runs commands to fetch such dependencies.

%p
  You can use <code>override</code>, <code>pre</code>, and/or <code>post</code> to modify
  %code dependencies
  commands.
  Here are examples of common tweaks you might make in the
  %code dependencies
  section.


.top-caption
  Example: using npm and Node.js

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      dependencies:
        override:
          - npm install --dev

.top-caption
  Example: using a specific version of bundler

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      dependencies:
        pre:
          - gem uninstall bundler
          - gem install bundler --pre

%h3#bundler
  Bundler flags

%p
  If your project includes bundler (the dependency management program for Ruby), you can include
  %code without
  to list dependency groups to be excluded from bundle install.
  Here's an example of what that would look like.



%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      dependencies:
        bundler:
          without: [production, osx]

%h3#cache-directories
  Custom Cache Directories

%p
  Circle caches dependencies between builds.
  To include any custom directories in our caching, you can use
  %code cache_directories
  to list any additional directories you'd like cached between builds.
  Here's an example of how you could cache two custom directories.

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      dependencies:
        cache_directories:
          - "assets/cache"    # relative to the build directory
          - "~/assets/output" # relative to the user's home directory

%p
  Caches are private, and are not shared with other projects.

%h2#database Database setup

%p
  Your web framework typically includes commands to create your database, install your schema, and run your migrations.
  You can use <code>override</code>, <code>pre</code>, and/or <code>post</code> to modify
  %code database
  commands.
  See <a href="/docs/manually#databases">Setting up your test database</a> for more information.

%p
  If our inferred <code>database.yml</code> isn't working for you, you may need to <code>override</code> our setup commands (as shown in the following example).
  If that is the case, please
  = HAML["contact_us"]()
  and let Circle know so that we can improve our inference.

%p
  %pre
    %code.bash<>
      :preserves
        database:
          override:
            - mv config/database.ci.yml config/database.yml
            - bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load --trace

%p
  FYI, you have the option of pointing to the location of your stored database config file using the <code>environment</code> modifier in the
  %code machine
  section.
%p
  %pre
    %code.bash<>
      :preserves
        machine:
          environment:
            DATABASE_URL: postgres://ubuntu:@127.0.0.1:5432/circle_test

%h2#test Running your tests

%p
  The most important part of testing is actually running the tests!

%p
  Circle supports the use of <code>override</code>, <code>pre</code>, and/or <code>post</code> in the <code>test</code> section.


.top-caption
  Example: running spinach after RSpec

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      test:
        post:
          - bundle exec rake spinach:
              environment:
                RAILS_ENV: test

.top-caption
  Example: running phpunit on a special directory

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      test:
        override:
          - phpunit my/special/subdirectory/tests
%p
  Circle also supports the use of <code>minitest_globs</code>
  (a list of file globs, using <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Dir.html#glob-method">Ruby's Dir.glob syntax</a>)
  that can list the file globs to be used during testing.

%p
%p
  By default, when testing in parallel, Circle runs all tests in the test/unit, test/integration, and
  test/functional directories.
  You can add <code>minitest_globs</code> to replace the
  standard directories with your own.
  This is needed only when you have additional or non-standard
  test directories and you are testing in parallel with MiniTest.

.top-caption
  Example: minitest_globs

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      test:
        minitest_globs:
          - test/integration/**/*.rb
          - test/extra-dir/**/*.rb
%p


%h2 Deployment


%p
  The
  %code deployment
  section is optional. You can run commands to deploy to staging or production.
  These commands are triggered only after a successful (green) build.

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      deployment:
        production:
          branch: production
          commands:
            - ./deploy_prod.sh
        staging:
          branch: master
          commands:
            - ./deploy_staging.sh
%p

  The
  %code deployment
  section consists of multiple subsections. In the example shown above, there
  are two&mdash;one named <i>production</i> and one named <i>staging</i>.
  Subsection names must be unique.
  Each subsection can list multiple branches, but at least one of these fields must be
  named <i>branch</i>. In instances of multiple branches, the first one that matches
  the branch being built is the one that is run.
  In the following example, if a developer pushes to any of the three branches listed, the script
  %code merge_to_master.sh
  is run.


%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      deployment:
        automerge:
          branch: [dev_alice, dev_bob, dev_carol]
          commands:
            - ./merge_to_master.sh
%p


%h3
  SSH Keys
%p
  If deploying to your servers requires SSH access, you'll need to
  upload the keys to Circle.
  Circle's UI enables you to do this on your project's <b>Edit settings > SSH keys</b> page.
  Add and then submit the one or more SSH keys needed
  for deploying to your machines. If you leave the <b>Hostname</b> field blank,
  the public key will be used for all hosts.


%h3
  Heroku

%p
  Circle also has first-class support for deploying to Heroku.
  Specify the app you'd like to
  %code git push
  to under <code>appname</code>.
  Upon a successful build, we'll automatically deploy to the app in the section that matches the push, if there is one.

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
      deployment:
        staging:
          branch: master
          heroku:
            appname: foo-bar-123

%p
  Setting up our deployment to Heroku requires one extra step.
  Due to Heroku's architecture and security model, we need to deploy as a particular user.
  A member of your project, possibly you, will need to register as that user.
  Circle's UI enables you to do this on your project's <b>Edit settings > Heroku settings</b> page.

%h3#heroku-extra
  Heroku with pre or post-deployment steps
%p
  If you want to deploy to Heroku and also run commands before or after the deploy, you must use the 'normal' deployment syntax.

%pre
  %code.bash<>
    :preserves
        deployment:
          production:
            branch: production
            commands:
              - git push git@heroku.com:foo-bar-123.git $CIRCLE_SHA1:master
              - heroku run rake db:migrate --app foo-bar-123
%p


%h2#notify Notifications

%p
  Circle sends personalized notifications by email.

%p
  In addition to these per-user emails, Circle sends notifications on a per-project basis.
  Circle supports sending webhooks when your build completes.
  Circle also supports HipChat, Campfire, and Flowdock notifications; you configure these notifications from your project's
  <b>Edit settings > Notifications </b> page.


%p
  This example sends a JSON packet to the specified URL.
  The JSON packet is identical to the result of the
  %a{ href: "/docs/reference-api#build" } Build API
  call for the same build.



%pre
  %code<>
    :preserves
      notify:
        webhooks:
          # A list of hashes representing hooks. Only the url field is supported.
          - url: https://example.com/hooks/circle
%p




%h2#help Need anything else?

%p
  We are adding support for configuring every part of your build.
  If you need to tweak something that isn't currently supported, please
  = HAML["contact_us"]()
  and we'll figure out how to make it happen.
