%p
  If your tests require a running solr instance, you will need to configure
  and boot solr before they run in CircleCI.

%h2 The Easy Way

%p
  In some cases, we can start solr automatically. In particular, if you're
  using ruby and the sunspot_solr gem, we'll run
  %code rake sunspot:solr:start
  by default, and it should Just Work.

%p
  If you're using a library or module with similar functionality (i.e. one
  that provides a bundled solr, and a wrapper for booting it), please
  =HAML['contact_us']()
  so that we can extend our inference to make it work automatically!

%h2 The Hard Way

%p
  Even if we aren't able to do things automatically,
  %code solr 4.2.1
  is installed on your build system. It will need to be configured with your
  schema.xml, and booted via
  = succeed '.', ->
    %a{ href: "/docs/configuration" }
      circle.yml
  Here's an example of how to do so:

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      database:
        post:
          - cp -R /opt/solr-4.2.1 $HOME/solr
          - cp config/schema.xml $HOME/solr/example/solr/collection1/conf
          # optional: - cp config/solrconfig.xml $HOME/solr/example/solr/collection1/conf
          - nohup bash -c "cd $HOME/solr/example; java -jar start.jar &" &gt; $HOME/solr.log

%p
  This configuration does three things. You may need to fine-tune the exact commands
  to match your needs, but they should:

  %ol
    %li
      Copy a skeletal solr installation from /opt/solr-4.2.1 into your home directory.
    %li
      Copy your configuration (schema.xml at least, and solrconfig.xml if you need it)
      into place.
    %li
      Launch solr as a
      = succeed '.', ->
        %a{ href: "/docs/background-process" }
          background process

%p
  Solr, when started this way, will be running under http://localhost:8983/solr/,
  and logging to $HOME/solr.log.

%p

  and let us know if you're using solr this way! Your feedback helps us keep our
  documentation up to date, and our services as useable as possible.
