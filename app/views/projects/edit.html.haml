        Enter a list of commands for each build phase. Each line is a separate
        program invocation, and any failing program (with an exit code of 0), will stop the build.
        After saving the form, you may test your builds with the trigger button.

                List of bash commands to set up your box. Most dependencies should already be
                installed, but you can `sudo apt-get install` those that aren't. We'll
                cache these steps so that they don't need to be run when they change.

                List of bash commands to install your project's libraries and
                dependencies. For example, `bundle install` for Rails or `lein deps`
                for Clojure. We'll cache these steps so to make them fast.

                List of bash commands to compile your code, for example 'configure',
                'make', or 'ant build'. You can usually ignore this for interpreted
                languages.
